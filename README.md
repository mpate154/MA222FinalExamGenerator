# MA222FinalExamGenerator
Using my file reading skills and data structures skills, I created a Final Exam Generator to help me study for my probability exam. Because past exams were given, this code picks random questions from past tests and creates an exam.

### But here's a summary

Given the past exams for the three tests given throughout the year, I made 3 text files with all the exams from each test (ex. all exam 1's were in a text file). I tried to use a converter but because of the different formats (some docx, some scanned jpegs, and some pdf), it was easier to copy and paste each exam manually. 

I took two questions from each exam to create a new exam. 

## Two ways to use this generator 
### 1. Clone this repository 

### 2. Download the raw code from the 'src' file, and all of the 'exam' text files, and open it up on your IDE

### Future additions
- Add techniques and upload files to ReadMe
- Use keys and hashsets to make sure questions added are unique and not repeats.
- Add comments to code
