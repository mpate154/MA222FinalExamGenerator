2. Accidents on a particular machine in a factory are Poisson distributed with an average of 4
accidents per 100 hours of operation.
a) What is the probability of at least one accident in the next 50 hours of production?
b) What is the probability that the time it takes to the first accident is less than 20
hours?
3. Assume that restaurant patrons who make a reservation for dinner have a 0.1 probability of
not showing up to honor the reservation, and that this probability is independent of other
patron’s decisions. If a restaurant accepts 20 reservations for 18 seats, what is the probability
that the restaurant will be overbooked? (overbooked means that more patrons show up than
there are seats)
4. An insurance policy on an electrical device pays a benefit of $4000 if the device fails during
the first year. The amount of the benefit decreases by $1,000 each successive year until it
reaches zero. If the device has not failed by the beginning of any given year, the probability of
failure during that year is 0.4 . What is the expected payout by the insurance company on this
policy?
5. Students in a class are sequentially tested for high blood pressure. Let X represent the
number of tests completed until the first student with high blood pressure is found. We are
given that the average value of X is 12.5 . Calculate the probability that the sixth student
tested is the first one with high blood pressure.
1. The number of arrivals at a facility has a Poisson probability distribution with average time
between arrivals of 20 seconds. What is the probability that there are no arrivals in the next
minute?
2. A study is being conducted in which the health of two independent groups of 10 people is
being monitored over a one-year period of time. Individual participants in the study drop out
